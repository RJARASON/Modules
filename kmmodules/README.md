**kmmodules**

This is a package of my python works.
I'm still adding some to it.


**HOW TO USE IT**

> from kmodules.module
you will see all the python scripts in this.
If you want to click 'Website'.
this is how you do it
> from kmmodules.module.Website import Openbrowser
>Openbrowser()
It will open the website that i created in chrome.
When you are importing kmmodules, do not click 'setup'.
you are only allowed to click 'module'.
